Firstly, dear jurors, good morning, good afternoon or good evening, depending on the time you take the time to read this.  I am very pleased to have the great opportunity to present to you the very very detailed description of our robotics project, developed with great effort and dedication for the competition of future engineers of the WRO.  Our team, called Circuit Wizards, has proudly entered our RB20 prototype (inspired by a Formula 1 car) in three regional competitions.  We are very excited to share with you the technical and functional details of our robot, which we consider like a son.

 The RB20 is the result of weeks of hard work and nights spent sleeping on coffee, "teamwork" and experimentation over and over again.  Its structure has two main engines, which are the center of its movement capacity.  These motors make the robot move forward and backward, with the ability to vary the speed from a minimum of 10% to a maximum of 100%.  This wide range of speeds allows for extremely precise control and adaptability to anything, which is crucial for operating in various situations and terrain (whether it is lonely, cloudy or if a hurricane is coming).  The ability to adjust the speed so precisely allows us to optimize the robot's performance at different stages of the track, whether in quick maneuvers where it will possibly crash or in slow, controlled movements.

 In addition to the central motor, the RB20 has a motor that acts as a steering wheel.  This motor is very important for the direction of the robot, helping it to turn to the right or left depending on what is necessary.  The robot's programming allows us to adjust the degrees of turn with horrible accuracy (I'm honest), ensuring that the RB20 can maneuver in tight spaces (it tries) or perform complex turns in a non-efficient manner.  The precision of the steering wheel is one of the characteristics that distinguishes our robot and allows it to navigate, with some difficulties (I'm not lying), along the paths of future engineers.

 To detect the color of obstacles and avoid them so that it does not crash and disqualify us, we have placed an optical sensor on the front of the robot.  This sensor is capable (sometimes) of identifying different colors and, based on this information, directing the robot to take the appropriate path.  In addition, we have installed an additional optical sensor to detect the orange and blue lines that mark the edges of the track.  This sensor allows the robot to rotate appropriately depending (from the draw on the day of the competition) on whether the path is clockwise or counterclockwise, thus ensuring that it stays within the established limits and does not crash.

 Safety and autonomous navigation capability are crucial aspects of our design.  We have* integrated two distance sensors strategically located on the front of the robot to ensure safe, crash-free navigation.  The right distance sensor is set to detect objects that are less than 10 centimeters away.  When the sensor detects an object at that distance, the robot automatically turns (supposedly) to the left 40 degrees, and after 0.5 seconds, corrects its direction by turning to the right to return to its original trajectory.  Likewise, the left distance sensor, placed on the left side of the front of the robot, is used when it detects an obstacle, helping to drive efficiently and safely.

 The implementation of these distance sensors helps it not to crash into the wall, but also helps the robot to walk autonomously on the track.  These sensors, in combination with the forward-reverse motor and steering wheel programming, allow the RB20 to attempt to quickly adapt to changes in its environment and avoid crashing into unexpected obstacles.


 The structural design (made of Lego) of the RB20 has also been painstakingly planned to ensure pieces do not come off during competition.  We use light but resistant materials (Lego)

 To power all of the RB20's electronics, we have opted for a high-capacity lithium-ion battery from vex robotics.  This battery offers an excellent relationship between weight and energy, providing enough power for long operating sessions without the need to charge it frequently.

In summary, the robot nicknamed RB20 from our team Circuit Wizards does not stand out very well for its capacity for movement and maneuverability (I do what I can), but also for its obstacle detection and avoidance system (although it detects late).  We are not very convinced that these characteristics will make our robot do a half-decent performance in regional robotics competitions.
