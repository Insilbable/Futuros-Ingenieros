Firstly, dear jurors, good morning, good afternoon or good evening, depending on the time you take the time to read this.  I am very pleased to have the great opportunity to present to you the very very detailed description of our robotics project, developed with great effort and dedication for the competition of future engineers of the WRO.  Our team, called Circuit Wizards, has proudly entered our RB20 prototype (inspired by a Formula 1 car) in three regional competitions.  We are very excited to share with you the technical and functional details of our robot, which we consider like a son.

 The RB20 is the result of weeks of hard work and nights sleeping with pure coffee, teamwork
  and experimentation over and over again.  Its structure has a main motor, which is the center of the movement capacity.  This motor makes the robot move forward and backward, with the ability to vary the speed from a minimum of 10% to a maximum of 100%.  This wide range of speeds allows for extremely precise and adaptable control, which is crucial for operating in various situations and terrain.  The ability to adjust the speed so precisely allows us to optimize the robot's performance at different stages of the track, whether in quick maneuvers where it will possibly crash or in slow, controlled movements.

 In addition to the central engine, the RB20 has a motor that acts as a flywheel.  This motor is very important for the direction of the robot, helping it to turn to the right or left depending on what is necessary.  The robot's programming allows us to adjust the degrees of rotation with normal accuracy, ensuring that the RB20 can maneuver in small spaces or perform complex turns in a non-efficient manner.  The precision of the steering wheel is one of the characteristics that distinguishes our robot and allows it to navigate normally along tracks the track of future engineers.

 To detect the color of obstacles and avoid them so that it does not crash, we have placed an optical sensor on the front of the robot.  This sensor is capable of identifying different colors and, based on this information, direct the robot to take the appropriate path.  In addition, we have installed an additional optical sensor to detect the orange and blue lines that mark the edges of the track.  This sensor allows the robot to rotate appropriately depending (from the draw on the day of the competition) on whether the path is clockwise or counterclockwise, thus ensuring that it stays within the established limits and does not crash.

 Safety and autonomous navigation capability are crucial aspects of our design.  We have integrated two distance sensors strategically located on the front of the robot to ensure safe and crash-free navigation. 

 The central distance sensor is set to detect objects that are less than 15 centimeters away.  When the sensor detects an object at that distance, the robot automatically turns to the left 40 degrees, and after 0.5 seconds, it corrects its direction by turning to the right to return to its original trajectory.

In addition to the central motor, the RB20 is equipped with a motor that acts as a flywheel. This motor is crucial for the robot's direction, helping it turn to the right or left as needed. The robot's programming allows us to adjust the degrees of rotation with high accuracy, ensuring that the RB20 can maneuver in small spaces or perform complex turns efficiently. The precision of the flywheel is one of the characteristics that distinguish our robot and allows it to navigate effectively along the track of future engineers.

To detect the color of obstacles and avoid collisions, we have placed an optical sensor on the front of the robot. This sensor is capable of identifying different colors and, based on this information, directing the robot to take the appropriate path. Additionally, we have installed another optical sensor to detect the orange and blue lines that mark the edges of the track. This sensor allows the robot to rotate appropriately depending on whether the path is clockwise or counterclockwise, thus ensuring that it stays within the established limits.

When the sensor detects an object at that distance, the robot automatically turns to the left 40 degrees, and after 0.5 seconds, it corrects its direction by turning to the right to return to its original trajectory. This implementation helps the robot not only avoid walls but also navigate autonomously on the track. This sensor, in combination with the forward-reverse motor and steering wheel programming, allows the RB20 to quickly adapt to changes in its environment and avoid unexpected obstacles.

The structural design of the RB20 has been painstakingly planned to ensure pieces do not come off during competition. We use light but resistant materials, primarily Lego, to construct the robot.

To power all of the RB20's electronics, we have opted for a high-capacity lithium-ion battery from Vex Robotics. This battery offers an excellent relationship between weight and energy, providing enough power for long operating sessions without the need for frequent recharging.

In summary, the robot nicknamed RB20 from our Circuit Wizards team stands out not only for its ability to move and maneuver but also for its obstacle detection and avoidance system. We are very confident that these features will make our robot perform well in regional robotics competitions.
